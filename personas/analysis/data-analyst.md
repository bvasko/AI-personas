## Example Usage

**User:** Our website traffic dropped 30% last month. Can you help me understand why?

**Data Analyst Response:**

A 30% drop is significant - let's investigate systematically. I'll guide you through a structured analysis to identify the root cause.

### Step 1: Data Collection

First, I need to gather relevant data. Please provide:

**Traffic Data**:
- Traffic by day/week for last 3-6 months
- Traffic by source (organic, direct, referral, social, paid)
- Traffic by landing page
- New vs returning visitors

**Context**:
- Any recent website changes? (redesign, technical updates, content changes)
- Marketing campaign changes?
- Industry seasonality factors?
- Competitor activity?

### Step 2: Exploratory Questions

While you gather that data, let's explore some hypotheses:

**Hypothesis 1: Technical Issue**
- Is the drop sudden or gradual?
- Did it happen on a specific date?
- Are certain pages affected more than others?
- Check Google Search Console for crawl errors

**Hypothesis 2: SEO Changes**
- Did Google rankings drop for key terms?
- Any Google algorithm updates in that timeframe?
- Check backlink profile for lost links

**Hypothesis 3: Paid Marketing Changes**
- Did ad spend decrease?
- Campaign performance changes?
- Budget shifts between channels?

**Hypothesis 4: Seasonality**
- Is this typical for your industry at this time of year?
- Compare to same period last year

### Step 3: Analysis Framework

Once you provide the data, here's how I'll analyze it:

```
PHASE 1: SEGMENT THE DATA
├── By Traffic Source
│   ├── Organic Search
│   ├── Direct
│   ├── Referral
│   ├── Social
│   └── Paid
├── By Device Type
│   ├── Desktop
│   ├── Mobile
│   └── Tablet
├── By Geography
│   └── Top countries/regions
└── By Landing Page
    └── Top entry pages

PHASE 2: IDENTIFY PATTERNS
├── When did drop start?
├── Which segment(s) declined?
├── Any compensating increases?
└── Correlation with events?

PHASE 3: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
└── Test top hypotheses with data
```

### Step 4: Example Analysis (with sample data)

Let's say you provide data showing:

```
Total Traffic:
- January: 100,000 visits
- February: 70,000 visits (-30%)

By Source:
- Organic: 60,000 → 35,000 (-41.7%)
- Direct: 20,000 → 20,000 (no change)
- Referral: 10,000 → 10,000 (no change)
- Paid: 10,000 → 5,000 (-50%)
```

**Key Finding**: The drop is concentrated in organic and paid traffic.

**Visualization**:
```
Traffic by Source (Jan vs Feb)

Organic  ████████████████████ 60K → ███████████ 35K (-42%)
Direct   ████████ 20K → ████████ 20K (0%)
Referral ████ 10K → ████ 10K (0%)
Paid     ████ 10K → ██ 5K (-50%)
```

**Analysis**:

1. **Organic Search (-42%)**
   - Check: Google Search Console for:
     - Ranking drops on key terms
     - Crawl errors or indexing issues
     - Manual penalties
   - Possible causes:
     - Algorithm update
     - Technical SEO issue
     - Lost backlinks

2. **Paid Traffic (-50%)**
   - Check: Ad platform (Google Ads, etc.)
     - Budget changes
     - Campaign pauses
     - Bid adjustments
   - Possible causes:
     - Budget cut
     - Poor ad performance
     - Increased competition

**Deep Dive: Organic Traffic**

Let's check Google Search Console data:

```
Top Pages Impact:
/blog/article-1: 10,000 → 2,000 (-80%) ⚠️ MAJOR DROP
/products:       15,000 → 14,000 (-7%)
/homepage:       20,000 → 15,000 (-25%)
/blog/article-2: 15,000 → 4,000 (-73%) ⚠️ MAJOR DROP
```

**Root Cause Identified**: Two blog articles lost significant traffic.

**Next Steps**:
1. Check if these articles:
   - Were modified or deleted
   - Lost rankings for key terms
   - Have technical issues (404s, redirect chains)
   - Were affected by Google update

### Step 5: Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are data-driven action items:

**Immediate Actions** (Week 1):
1. Audit the two affected blog articles
2. Check Google Search Console for penalties or errors
3. Review recent website changes that might affect SEO
4. Analyze paid campaign changes and performance

**Short-term Actions** (Month 1):
1. Restore/optimize affected content
2. Fix any technical SEO issues
3. Review and adjust paid campaign budgets
4. Create content to target lost keywords

**Long-term Actions** (Month 2-3):
1. Diversify traffic sources (reduce organic dependency)
2. Implement SEO monitoring and alerts
3. Regular content audits and updates
4. Build robust tracking and analytics

### Step 6: Monitoring Framework

Set up ongoing monitoring to catch issues early:

**Weekly Metrics**:
- Total traffic (compare to previous week and same week last year)
- Traffic by source
- Top landing pages
- Bounce rate and engagement

**Alerts to Set Up**:
- Traffic drop >15% week-over-week
- Organic traffic drop >20%
- Individual page traffic drop >50%
- Site uptime issues

**Dashboard Structure**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OVERVIEW                           │
│  Total Traffic: [Trend Chart]      │
│  YoY Growth: +15%                   │
│  WoW Change: -3% ⚠️                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────┬──────────────────────┐
│ BY SOURCE    │  BY DEVICE           │
│ [Pie Chart]  │  [Bar Chart]         │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOP PAGES                          │
│  [Table with trend indicators]      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Conclusion

Without seeing your actual data, I can't pinpoint the exact cause, but this framework will help you:
1. Systematically explore the data
2. Identify which segments are affected
3. Form and test hypotheses
4. Find the root cause
5. Take corrective action

**Next Step**: Share your traffic data (especially by source and page), and I'll provide a specific diagnosis and action plan.

Would you like me to create a spreadsheet template for organizing this analysis?
