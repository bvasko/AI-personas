# Contributing to AI Personas

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collection! We welcome high-quality AI personas that can help others get more value from their AI assistants.

## Guidelines

### What Makes a Good Persona?

A good AI persona should be:
- **Specific**: Clearly defined role and expertise
- **Useful**: Solves a real need or use case
- **Well-structured**: Easy to understand and use
- **Tested**: You've used it yourself and found it effective

### Persona Requirements

1. **Use the Template**: Base your persona on [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md)
2. **Clear Purpose**: The persona should have a clear, specific purpose
3. **Complete Documentation**: Include all sections from the template
4. **Example Usage**: Provide at least one example of the persona in action
5. **Proper Category**: Place it in the appropriate directory

### Directory Structure

Place your persona in the correct category:
- `personas/coding/` - Programming, development, debugging
- `personas/writing/` - Content creation, documentation, copywriting
- `personas/analysis/` - Data analysis, research, critical thinking
- `personas/general/` - General purpose personas that don't fit elsewhere

### File Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens:
- ✅ `expert-code-reviewer.md`
- ✅ `technical-writer.md`
- ❌ `persona1.md`
- ❌ `MyPersona.md`
